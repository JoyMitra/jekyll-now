I am PHD student at Kansas State University. I am deeply interested in studying software systems and how to make them more sucre, reliable and dependable. I am currently working on Android security. More specifically, I am studying Android apps and how they can be vulnerable. I am also interested in software methodology and programming languages. My eventual goal is to explore if programming language techniques can be applied to develop a design methodology that will result in secure Android apps.
